quest #1

on my words :) after the bootcamp I'll read this again to see if I was almost right :P 

The blockchain is data decentralized no mutable that is made by blocks that are extremely secure that cannot be amend , basically used to make transactions without a third party involved.

An smart contract is what a developer does in the blockchain through an language as Cadence to give rules to the blockchain determine actions( “if/when...then…” rules that govern those transactions) that must execute to be certain too all the attendees 

script   vs   transaccion :

script is the place where you can view you code and scripts are FREE,  and transcaction is the function the method that is updated in the blockchain.

quest #2

What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

1. Safety and Securit
2. Clarity
3. Approachability
4. Developer Experience
5. Resource Oriented Programming

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

I think Developer Experience and Safety Security , the first one  because is very important the mental health of the developer, and the second one because with that pillar we could develop a useful and safe smart contract and feel confident with that
